Title: I Am Thankful...

I considered not writing this post, because I feel like Thanksgiving
blog/Facebook posts are pretty clich√©d.

But, I also think that we don't focus enough on how blessed we are. And I
definitely don't give thanks often enough. So here goes.

I am thankful for my parents. My mom and dad are the single greatest influence
on my life, and that influence has been overwhelmingly for good. I'm a little
overwhelmed with just how much I owe them, and by how truly good they are. From
a very early age, they have instilled in me the importance of good things in
my life, the importance of hard work, and the idea that I can accomplish
anything. They are my pillars. Thanks, Mom and Dad.

I am grateful for the Gospel of Jesus Christ in my life. I am a member of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Some know us as Mormons. The
strength and joy that the Gospel has brought into my life are impossible to put
into words. I am grateful for the Spirit's influence in my life, for the
guidance I receive. I am so blessed, and I know it all comes from my Heavenly
Father. I am grateful for the cleansing power of the Atonement. Jesus Christ
suffered and died for me, and it is the single greatest blessing in my life.

I am grateful to have a great job, and the opportunity to work with great
people. I work at SaltStack, a startup which produces software for server
management and automation. The work is really interesting, and I have some of
the best coworkers around. They're continually inspiring me to do great work.

Finally, I am grateful for my family. I had the opportunity to hang out with
almost all of my immediate family, and a good chunk of my extended family
today. It was a blast. I love these people, and am so glad that they're in my
life. I hear about all the drama-filled Thanksgivings that so many people
endure -- I can't relate to that. Thanksgiving is always a great time with my
family.

Happy Thanksgiving!
