Title: "First" Post

Once again, this is my "first" post.

Both of my blogs are now [generated with Pelican][friction] and are [auto
publishing][auto], which brings the friction cost of blogging to a whole new
low for me. This time, I'm going to actually blog from time to time! (You can
insert some comment about my terrible track record here, but I'll ignore it --
there is no try!)

[auto]: http://blog.basepi.net/2014/11/blog-auto-publish-with-dropbox/

I will note that I hope for a bit of a tone change in this blog. I plan to
write about my life, sure. But I hope to also write more about things that are
important to me, whether that's the Gospel (I'm a member of the [LDS
Church](http://mormon.org)), my family, or just my thoughts on events or
issues.

That's it for now. You can follow using the RSS link at the top! And remember
to comment or [tweet at me](http://twitter.com/basepi)! I'd love to get a
discussion going.
